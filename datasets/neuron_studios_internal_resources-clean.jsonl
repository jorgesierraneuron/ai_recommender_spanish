For medium-sized manufacturing companies, however, there is a risk of missing out on the developments and potential of AI. Many companies lack the expertise and experience to take the first steps towards more intelligent production on their own without expert guidance. The Fraunhofer Alliance Big Data AI therefore bundles its expertise in the fields of AI and production and offers the management of manufacturing companies a structured introduction to this complex topic. The use of AI seems to be indispensable in the future to increase the productivity and competitiveness of enterprises. Today, especially small and medium sized companies are facing the task of implementing AI with regard to their own business model in suitable use cases at reasonable costs. In cooperation with other institutes of the Fraunhofer Alliance Big Data AI, Fraunhofer IPT offers manufacturing companies the opportunity to apply expert knowledge from research into artificial intelligence in a targeted manner to industrial practice. To this end, the researchers have developed the \"AI Kick-Starter Bundle\" in an interdisciplinary alliance.

Reasons for this are that internal company data is available in an unstructured form, does not contain the relevant information or is not stored in sufficient quantities. In these cases, it is possible to gain initial experience in the use of machine learning by using freely available data sets. However, the publicly available data sets in the production area are stored on different platforms. To gather initial experience, the Fraunhofer IPT has collected and compiled publicly available data sets for companies with a focus on »production«. These data sets can be assigned to the eight most important fields of application.
